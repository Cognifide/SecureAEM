# Secure AEM

## Introduction

Secure AEM is a tool which can be used to find the most popular security problems in your AEM instance.

See the main repo for more information: https://github.com/Cognifide/SecureAEM

In this fork I'm only focussing on getting a decent working CLI to verify the adobe AEM security checklist.
